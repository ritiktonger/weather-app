### Important!
Please provide your own [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) API keys when running these codes.  You will need to save the Open Weather Map key in a 'config.py' file in the WeatherPy folder, and save the Google Maps API key in a 'config.py' file in the VacationPy folder.

### WeatherPy
A jupyter notebook that gets a random set of latitudes and longitudes and finds the corresponding cities using [citipy](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/).  Uses the random cities to find current weather conditions (with temperature min and max) and plots various weather attributes across latitudes.

### VacationPy
A jupyter notebook that takes the location and weather data from WeatherPy and plots them on a Google Maps figure.  The list of cities is filtered to find locations with 
- A maximum temperature over 70F but under 80F
- Wind speed less than 10 mph
- No clouds

The Google Maps API is then used to search for the nearest hotel to each lat/long location, and plots these hotels on a map.  Click the map pins to see the name, city, and country of the hotel.
